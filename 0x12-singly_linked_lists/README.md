C - Singly linked lists


Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. It aims to learn about linked lists in C language.

 Learning Objectives

 At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:



 
 Requirements

 General

 Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

 All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

 All your files should end with a new line

 A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

 Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

 You are not allowed to use global variables

 No more than 5 functions per file

 The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden

 You are allowed to use _putchar

 You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

 All of the following files are programs written in C:



Filename(Task)	                       Description


0-print_list.c	          Prints all the elements of a list_t list

1-list_len.c	          Returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list

2-add_node.c	          Adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list

3-add_node_end.c	  Adds a new node at the end of a list_t list

4-free_list.c	          Frees a list_t list

100-first.c	          Print a message before main function is executed

101-hello_holberton.asm	  Assembly code that prints Hello, Holberton only using printf function
